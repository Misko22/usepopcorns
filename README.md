# UsePopcorns 🎬🍿

**UsePopcorns** is a **React-based movie rating app** where you can browse, rate, and track movies you’ve watched. 🎥✨

While this app isn’t **biotech-related** (yet 👀), I decided to start with something **fun and universal—movies!** 🍿 Because, let’s face it, whether you’re decoding DNA or debugging JavaScript, we all need a little **Scarface or Titanic moment** now and then.

But hey, I’m **crossing my fingers 🤞** that my **next project** will mix **biotech and software development** (think **genes meet JavaScript** 🧬💻). For now, this project helps me **build my frontend skills** and collect as much **feedback** as possible—**so don’t hold back!**  

**Learning in public** is scary, but it’s the best way to grow. So here I am, sharing this **work-in-progress**, every line of code representing a step toward **professionalism** (and maybe, world domination... kidding! 😅).

Feel free to **explore**, **break things**, or **drop feedback**. I **welcome collaboration**, **ideas**, or even **movie recommendations** (because popcorn without movies is just sad 💔).
